Veracode Gradle Plugin that automates Veracode application security scanning activities.

As a set of Gradle tasks, it is meant to be usable either as a command line submission tool or integrated as part of a continuous integration build process.

It helps perform the following tasks:

* Perform Veracode submissions for applications.
* Retrieve Scan reports.

== Pre-Requisites

* Veracode account & application to perform scanning.
* JDK 7+ is a requirement for the Veracode Java API.

== Getting Started

The plugin is published as a gradle plugin: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.calgaryscientific.gradle.veracode

=== Apply the plugin into your project

. Create a new Gradle project.

. Copy the `VeracodeJavaAPI.jar` (from Veracode) to a newly created `lib` directory within your project.

. Apply the plugin with a minimal setup:
+
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'groovy'
apply plugin: 'com.calgaryscientific.gradle.veracode'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
          url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'gradle.plugin.com.calgaryscientific.gradle:veracodePlugin:0.6.0'
    }
}

veracodeSetup {
    // Authentication
    username = project.findProperty("veracodeUsername") <1>
    password = project.findProperty("veracodePassword")
    id = project.findProperty("veracodeID") <1>
    key = project.findProperty("veracodeKey")

    // App info
    app_id = project.findProperty("veracodeAppID")

    // Upload Config
    filesToUpload = fileTree(dir: "upload/", include: "*").getFiles()
    sandboxFilesToUpload = fileTree(dir: "upload/", include: "*").getFiles()

    // Scan Config
    moduleWhitelist = ['class1.jar', 'class2.jar']
}
----
<1> You are only required to use either username and password combination or API id and key.

. Rename the `sample-gradle.properties` file to `gradle.properties` within your project and edit its contents to setup Veracode credentials.
Optionally, the Veracode credentials properties can be placed in the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.

. Execute `gradle tasks` to see available tasks.

=== veracodeSetup extension

The `veracodeSetup` extension is used to configure the Plugin and to pass details to the tasks.

A minimal setup is shown above, a full description of all fields is shown below:

.veracodeSetup configuration
[source,groovy]
----
// Authentication
String username
String password
String id
String key

// Output location
String outputDir = "${project.buildDir}/veracode"

// App and Sandbox
String app_id
String sandbox_id
String sandbox_name

// Build Info
String build_id
String build_version

// Flaw Info
String flaw_id
String flaw_id_list
String action
String comment
String cweid

// File Info
String file_id

// Upload Config
Boolean deleteUploadedArtifacts = false
Integer maxUploadAttempts = 10
Integer waitTimeBetweenAttempts = 5000
Set<File> filesToUpload
Set<File> sandboxFilesToUpload

// Scan Config
Set<String> moduleWhitelist

// Error Management
Boolean ignoreFailure = false

// Workflow reports
Boolean failWorkflowTasksOnNewFlaws = false
----

To pass these fields to the Plugin as properties, set the field on `veracodeSetup` to read the desired property, for example:

----
veracodeSetup {
    ...
    build_id = project.findProperty("build_id")
}
----

Then:

----
./gradlew veracodeDetailedReport -P build_id=xxx
----


=== Work flow tasks (CI environment)

The full work flow tasks are meant to be used in a CI environment.

A single task will do the following:

* _Query the status_ of the latest build:
  ** If the latest build Scan is complete:
    . Get latest build’s _Detailed Report_ and print flaw summary.
    . _Creates a new build_.
    . _Uploads the given files_ to the Veracode platform.
    . _Begins a Pre-Scan_ of the uploaded files.
    . Optionally fail the build if there were new flaws from the _Detailed Report_ on step 1.

  ** If the latest build has a completed Pre-scan:
    *** _Begins the Scan_ of the application selecting the given white list modules.

  ** If the Pre-scan or Scan is in progress:
    *** Doesn't run any steps.

A sample configuration looks like this:

[source,groovy]
----
task veracodeBuildWorkflow(type: com.calgaryscientific.gradle.VeracodeWorkflowTask) {
    dependsOn buildMyApplication
    doFirst {
        veracodeSetup {
            build_version =  "build-name-if-creating-a-new-build"
            ignoreFailure =  true <1>
            filesToUpload = fileTree(dir: "upload/", include: "*").getFiles() <2>
            failWorkflowTasksOnNewFlaws = true <3>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Optionally ignore failures to avoid stopping the build process if there is a problem with the Veracode calls.
<2> Setup `veracodeSetup` `filesToUpload` again to ensure it is evaluated after the `buildMyApplication` task.
<3> Optionally fail the task if there are new flaws introduced in the latest build.
The failure will be triggered after a new build creation, file upload and pre-scan submission.

This task can be triggered by every commit and will only create a new build, upload files, begin pre-scans or begin scans when the Veracode platform is ready for it.

The Sandbox counterpart can be used as:

[source,groovy]
----
task veracodeBuildWorkflow(type: com.calgaryscientific.gradle.VeracodeWorkflowSandboxTask) {
    dependsOn buildMyApplication
    doFirst {
        veracodeSetup {
            build_version =  "build-name-if-creating-a-new-sandbox-build"
            ignoreFailure =  true
            sandboxFilesToUpload = fileTree(dir: "upload/", include: "*").getFiles()
            failWorkflowTasksOnNewFlaws = true
        }
    }
}
----

=== Building Using a local Java API Wrapper

Gradle doesn't support verifying PGP keys.
If you want to use a local Java API Wrapper instead of the Maven provided one, follow these steps:

. Uncomment the local dependency code on `build.gradle` and comment out the Maven Central one.
. Copy the Veracode Java API JAR file to a newly created `lib` directory.
The https://tools.veracode.com/integrations/API-Wrappers/Java/bin/VeracodeJavaAPI.zip[zip file] is found in the https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/helpCenter/api/c_about_wrappers.html[documentation] from Veracode's website.
